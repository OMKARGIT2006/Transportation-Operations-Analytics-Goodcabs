## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyzes **GoodCabs’ transportation operations** across **10 tier-2 Indian cities** using **SQL, Excel, and Power BI**.  
The goal is to transform raw operational data into **actionable business insights** that help leadership make data-driven decisions for 2024.

**End-to-End Workflow:**  
Data Collection → Cleaning → Analysis → Visualization → Insights → Recommendations

## 🎯 Business Problem

GoodCabs operates in tier-2 cities with ambitious performance targets, but leadership lacks:
- Clear visibility into trip volume and revenue
- Insights into passenger retention
- Understanding of pricing efficiency
- City-wise service quality comparison

This makes it difficult to identify performance gaps and growth opportunities.

---

## 🧠 Business Objectives

- Evaluate operational performance across cities  
- Measure actual vs target trips and ratings  
- Analyze repeat passenger behavior  
- Identify top and underperforming cities  
- Support strategic and operational decision-making  

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

- **Source:** Codebasics  
- **Time Period:** 2024 (6 months)

### Key Data Domains
- 🚕 Trip Metrics: total trips, distance travelled, fare per trip/km  
- 👥 Passenger Metrics: total, new, repeat passengers, retention rate  
- ⭐ Ratings: driver and passenger ratings  
- 💰 Financials: revenue, growth rate  
- 🎯 Targets: trips, passengers, ratings  

> ⚠️ *Limitation:* Six-month data may not fully capture long-term seasonality.

## 📈 Key Insights & Findings

- **Jaipur** is the top-performing city in trips, revenue, distance, and average fare.  
- **Surat and Lucknow** show higher repeat passenger rates despite lower trip volumes.  
- Cities like **Indore and Vadodara** maintain stable ratings even with lower fares.  
- Seasonal trends show higher demand in **January–February**, declining toward June.  
- Higher ratings do not always result in higher revenue or trip volume.
